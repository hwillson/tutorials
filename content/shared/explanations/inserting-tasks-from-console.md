### Inserting tasks from the server-side database console

Items inside collections are called _documents_. Let's use the server database console to insert some documents into our collection. In a new terminal tab, go to your app directory and type:

```bash
meteor mongo
```

This opens a console into your app's local development database. Into the prompt, type:

```js
db.tasks.insert({ text: "Hello world!", createdAt: new Date() });
```

In your web browser, you will see the UI of your app immediately update to show the new task. You can see that we didn't have to write any code to connect the server-side database to our front-end code &mdash; it just happened automatically.

Insert a few more tasks from the database console with different text. In the next step, we'll see how to add functionality to our app's UI so that we can add tasks without using the database console.
